        bio: "I am an undergrad at CSU majoring in computer science. I am also a UTA for CS165 data structures and algorithms. Throughout my career, I want to help shape the future of artificial intelligence by leading projects that push the boundaries of what's possible in fields such as education and environmental studies. To start accomplishing these goals, last year, I wrote a website that is an AI chatbot for helping tutor students in their classes and have it deployed on Heroku. Outside of school, I enjoy producing music and camping.",

I find computers and programming interesting, yet I hope to one day be on the business side of consulting with a computer background for that job. I'm looking at ways to improve my resume for internships this upcoming summer, and I am also interested in getting involved with more projects in the Computer Science industry. I love to pick up hobbies as I go, with trouble committing to just one. Hanging out with friends, working out, and going outside are all great releases for me.",
